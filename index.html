    <h1>CANA Whitepaper: Own Reality</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction: From Conversation to Revolution</h2>
        <p>CANA ($CANA) is more than a coin, a brand, or a product line—it's a cultural shift born from a simple conversation about wellness, identity, and the canna lifestyle.</p>
        <p>From these early talks, a movement emerged—one rooted in authenticity, sustainability, and creative ownership. In an era where blockchain often feels distant from real life, CANA bridges the gap. We connect real-world products with on-chain proof, making ownership smarter, more meaningful, and deeply personal.</p>
        <p>We're reimagining what it means to own.</p>
        <p>With Real-World Asset (RWA)-Backed NFTs, CANA enables users to own digital tokens that are intrinsically tied to physical items—each item is traceable, verifiable, and one-of-a-kind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Vision: Own the Culture. Shape the Future.</h2>
        <p>Ownership should go beyond possession—it should be proof, participation, and potential.</p>
        <p>Imagine a world where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your hoodie is a verified asset</li>
            <li>Your sneakers have an identity you can scan</li>
            <li>Every item you own exists both in real life and the metaverse</li>
            <li>Reselling doesn't just transfer a product, it transfers an entire history</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CANA is turning that vision into a tangible, blockchain-powered reality. Welcome to the era of smart, circular ownership.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. The Story: From Waste to Worth, One of One</h2>
        <p>[...] Once your destruction video is verified, the NFT is cleared for resale. The new buyer, upon purchase, receives a brand-new physical product, tied to that same NFT identity—reborn, but never duplicated.</p>
        <p>This isn't just resale—it's ritual. Responsibility. Rarity.</p>
        <p>And yes—you, the original owner, receive 50% of the resale value automatically. The other 50% goes to CANA as a resale royalty, which funds the reproduction of the new physical item.</p>
        <p>That's ownership redefined—from waste to worth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Core Components</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 RWA-Backed NFT Collection</h3>
        <p>Every CANA NFT represents a real physical product:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Streetwear & apparel</li>
            <li>Lifestyle gear</li>
            <li>Limited-edition collectibles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you mint:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You get a digital NFT, stored in your wallet</li>
            <li>You receive a physical product, delivered to you</li>
            <li>Both are tied via a unique QR code, registered on-chain</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4.2 Proof of Ownership via QR Code</h3>
        <p>Each item is embedded with a QR code that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Links to the NFT's blockchain record</li>
            <li>Confirms product authenticity and ownership history</li>
            <li>Enables resale with royalty triggers</li>
            <li>Protects uniqueness in secondary markets</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This system prevents counterfeits, empowers resale, and keeps value alive across owners.</p>
        
        <h3>4.3 One-of-One Protocol: Destruction Before Resale</h3>
        <p>We don't believe in mass replication. We believe in uniqueness.</p>
        <p>Before reselling any CANA NFT, the original physical product must be destroyed—a video recording is required as proof. This ensures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No two people ever own the same physical item</li>
            <li>The rarity and integrity of the NFT remain intact</li>
            <li>The incoming buyer receives a newly manufactured version of the same one-of-one item</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's more than resale—it's legacy transfer.</p>
        
        <h3>4.4 Cross-Reality Integration</h3>
        <p>Own it in real life. Wear it in digital worlds.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Link your hoodie to a video game</li>
            <li>Equip your avatar with your physical sneakers</li>
            <li>Mirror your offline identity in the metaverse</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We're integrating with gaming and virtual platforms to bring your style across realities.</p>
        
        <h3>4.5 Community-First Utility & Benefits</h3>
        <p>At CANA, ownership = membership.</p>
        <p>Holding a verified CANA NFT unlocks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Early access to new collections</li>
            <li>Time-based perks for long-term holders</li>
            <li>In-game boosts & power-ups</li>
            <li>50% resale payout to sellers when your item is resold via our marketplace</li>
            <li>50% royalty goes to CANA to fund reproduction of new items for future buyers</li>
            <li>Exclusive airdrops, merch, and events</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We're not just building a platform. We're building a tribe.</p>
